# Grade-Reader-for-Student-Home
A program to automatically read grades submitted by students to their student housing landlord to verify that the student has completed the required amount of courses.

The program was created to remove the administrative task of verifying the records (grades) of the student (sent in by the student by a web platform) performed by the student housing administrators. Instead the program can verify the records and notify the student immediatly of the result without involing the administrators.
